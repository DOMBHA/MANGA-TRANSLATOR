# Manga_Translator (Work in progress)

This is the model pipeline in our self-designed application--"Mlator", which is aimed to help manga fans and publishers to overcome the language barrie and lower the cost of translation respectively. 

# Workflow
This example image is from <<Q.E.D. iff - proven end - 11>> Episode 1 Â© Motohiro Katou.

## Bubble Detection
First, train a object detection model that helps us locate the text in the bubble. Here we thanks to ** Manga109** providing us with large amount of high quality annotated dataset.As the following image shows, the identified areas are marked with orange bounding boxes.

## Optical Character Recognition
Next we use a state-of-the-art OCR engine to parse the image segment we identified in step 1 into machine-readable text.
We also apply a few special tricks to help the model parse vertically-oriented Japanese text and stylized comic fonts.
